To extend support to the victims of the devastating flood, anyone from anywhere could donate directly through bKash to well-known charities and volunteer organizations, according to a bKash press release on Tuesday.

It said many people are also using “send money” and “cash in” service of bKash to support individual aid efforts in the affected areas, which are in urgent need for food, drinking water, medicine, and other lifesaving goods.

Besides, after the receding of the flood water, various health risks, including water-borne infectious diseases may appear in the affected areas.

Under such circumstances, the government as well as different charity and volunteer organisations are urging everyone to donate as per their capacity.

Donations through bKash could be sent to different organizations, including – Chief Adviser’s Relief and Welfare Fund, Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, Bangladesh Army Relief Fund, Armed Forces Division Relief Fund, BRAC, Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, Bangladesh Navy (BNFWA Donation Fund), Bangladesh Air Force Welfare Trust, As-sunnahFoundation, Obhizatrik Foundation, Anjuman Mufidul Islam, Mastul Foundation, Prothom Alo Trust, etc.

To donate, customers need to click on the “Donation” icon on the bKash app and then select their preferred organization, enter their name, email and donation amount.

If customers want, they can keep their identity hidden by selecting the “unwilling to reveal identity” option.

After tapping on “submit” and entering the PIN, the donation process will be completed.

In the last stage, customers will get an acknowledgment receipt. Besides, donations can also be made by dialing *247#.

Customers can also see detailed information about the organization by tapping the “know more” option below the organization’s name.

He made the comment when he made a courtesy call to the Chief Adviser of the interim Bangladesh government Professor Muhammad Yunus at the state guest house Jamuna

During the meeting, he discussed the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, which Bangladesh is building with technical and financial support from Russia, and increased cooperation on food security, energy exploration and science and technology.

He said the state-run Russian energy company Gazprom has expressed interest in exploring five more gas wells in the island of Bhola and more wells inland.

He said the construction of the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant is at the final stage and is expected to go into operation next year. He said Russia was also interested in exporting LNG to Bangladesh.

Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus recalled Russia's role during Bangladesh's glorious War of Independence and its vital mine cleaning operations in the Chittagong Port.

He called the Russian envoy to increase imports from Bangladesh, including products other than readymade garments, which constitute some 90% of Dhaka's exports to Russia.

""We need to diversify our exports,"" he said.

Ambassador Mantytsky said Russia is a key economic partner of Bangladesh as it exports vital foodgrains and fertilizer to the country.

Advocate Sharif Bhuiyan and Barrister Tanim Hussain Shawon submitted the review petition on behalf of five citizens including Badiul Alam Majumdar, secretary of the rights organization “Shushaner Jonmo Nagorik”.

The petition outlines approximately 14 grounds on which the Supreme Court may reconsider its judgment.

The other petitioners are- Tofail Ahmed, M Hafizuddin Khan, Md Jobirul Hoque Bhuiyan and Zahrah Rahman.

The petition sought the cancellation of the judgment of the Appellate Division which invalidated the caretaker government system by declaring the 13th amendment of the Constitution illegal.

At the same time, a request has been made to bring back the caretaker government system, said lawyer Sharif.

On August 19, the High Court issued a rule asking why the abolition of the caretaker government system through the 15th Amendment of the Constitution should not be declared illegal.

The court also asked the government to respond within eight weeks.

On Sunday, the Appellate Division Chamber Court granted permission to submit the petition, following a request from five prominent citizens, thereby allowing for a reconsideration of the earlier decision.

Following the fall of dictator Ershad in 1990, the 13th Amendment introduced the caretaker government system into the Constitution. Supreme Court lawyer M Salimullah (now dead) and others filed a writ petition with the High Court in 1998 challenging the validity of this amendment.

The High Court on August 4, 2004 declared the 13th Amendment of the Constitution as valid and constitutional.

The court, however, allowed the writ petitioners to directly file an appeal with the Appellate Division challenging its judgment.

Following this, the writ petitioners in 2005 appealed before the Appellate Division against the High Court verdict.

The Appellate Division then announced the verdict on May 10, 2010, allowing this appeal.

After the verdict was announced, the 15th Amendment Act was passed by the National Parliament on June 30, 2011, bringing several issues, including the abolition of the caretaker government system.

A gazette was published on July 3, 2011.

This amendment reinstated secularism and religious freedom in the Constitution and added nationalism, socialism, democracy, and secularism as state principles.

Through this amendment, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was also recognized as the Father of the Nation.

Additionally, the caretaker government system was abolished. The number of reserved seats for women in the national parliament was increased from 45 to 50.

Two new clauses, 7(A) and 7(B), were added after Article 7 of the Constitution, which aimed to prevent any unconstitutional seizure of state power.

The bill was passed with a vote of 291-1, amidst a boycott by the opposition party, BNP."
